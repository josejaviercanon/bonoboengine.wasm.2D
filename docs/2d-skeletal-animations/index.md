# Blender-to-glTF 2.0 asset pipeline into a .NET WebAssembly (WASM) Entity Component System (ECS) engine rendering via PixiJS

Integrating a Blender-to-glTF 2.0 asset pipeline into a .NET WebAssembly (WASM) Entity Component System (ECS) engine rendering via PixiJS requires mapping open 3D asset specifications to data-oriented C# structures and JavaScript rendering buffers.

## Two Pipelines & the glTF-as-Input Rule

This document refines the Bonobo skeletal-animation architecture (see `docs/adr/ADR-004` and `docs/architecture/topology.md`). The key rule:

- **glTF (`.glb`) is the asset contract, not the ECS architecture.** Authoring and runtime are two **independent** pipelines that communicate only through the `.glb` asset:

```
Pipeline A — Authoring (offline):   AI Agent + Blender bpy → armature + animations → .glb
Pipeline B — Runtime:               .glb → glTF Importer (C#) → ECS → AnimationSystem
                                          → TransformSystem → SkinningSystem → PixiJS/GPU
```

- `AI + Blender = Content Pipeline`, **not** `Game Runtime`. The AI authoring agent does **not** live inside the game runtime.
- **Don't create one ECS entity per glTF node.** A character is one entity with contiguous-array `SkeletonComponent` (`ParentIndices[]`, `LocalTransforms[]`, `GlobalTransforms[]`, `InverseBindMatrices[]`) for cache-friendly iteration.
- **The animation state machine belongs to the ECS (Bonobo-native), not glTF.** glTF stores clips/samplers/channels/interpolation modes (LINEAR/STEP/CUBICSPLINE); the engine decides `CurrentClip`, `Time`, `Speed`, `Loop`, `BlendTarget`, `BlendWeight`.
- Both pipelines are independently swappable (Blender ↔ another tool; runtime ↔ another renderer) because they share only the asset contract.

The Pipeline Architecture Overview below predates this rule and uses a per-node entity mapping (`SkinComponent` joint `Entity` IDs, `PixiRenderNodeComponent`); treat that as one valid concrete mapping, while the ADR-004 contiguous-array representation is the preferred data-oriented target.

AI agents interact with this architecture at three key insertion points: offline asset synthesis in Blender, structural JSON buffer manipulation in memory, and real-time state mutation inside the C# ECS loop.

## Architectural Component Mapping

* **Node Hierarchy to Entity Archetypes:** The glTF loader parses `.glb` node trees, instantiating individual entities for each bone and mesh node. Entities store local transformations as value-type structs ($\vec{t}, q, \vec{s}$) alongside `ParentEntity` and `ChildrenEntities` relational components.
* **Skinning Data Components (`SkinComponent`):** Stores an array of joint `Entity` IDs, an Inverse Bind Matrix array pointer ($B_j^{-1}$), and a target vertex deformation buffer.
* **Animation State Components (`AnimationPlayerComponent`):** Stores timeline keyframe buffers, active clip indices, and playback state $t$.
* **Render Link Component (`PixiRenderNodeComponent`):** Holds a unique integer handle referencing the corresponding `PIXI.Mesh` or `PIXI.Container` instance instantiated on the JavaScript context.

## Transformations & Rendering Pipeline

1. **Sampler Sampling System:** Evaluates glTF animation channel curves at current time $t$, computing interpolated local translation, rotation, and scale values:

$$\vec{t}(t) = \text{lerp}(\vec{t}_a, \vec{t}_b, \alpha), \quad q(t) = \text{slerp}(q_a, q_b, \alpha)$$


2. **Transform Propagation System:** Processes hierarchical entity transforms top-down to compute global transformation matrices:

$$T_{\text{global}, j} = T_{\text{global}, \text{parent}(j)} \times T_{\text{local}, j}$$


3. **Skinning Palette System:** Computes joint skinning matrices to deform 2D/3D mesh vertices:

$$M_j = T_{\text{mesh\_global}}^{-1} \times T_{\text{global}, j} \times B_j^{-1}$$


4. **PixiJS Memory Synchronization:** The evaluated joint palette $M_j$ or updated vertex array is copied across the WASM boundary into PixiJS's WebGL/WebGPU vertex buffers (`PIXI.Mesh` or `PIXI.SimpleRope`) using direct WebAssembly memory views (`Float32Array`) via `[JSImport]`.

## AI Agent Integration Strategies

| Agent Strategy | Execution Layer | Latency & Performance | Capabilities & Scope | Primary Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Authoring-Time Agent** | Blender (`bpy` Python API) | Offline (Batch Processing) | Full armature creation, automated mesh weighting, procedural NLA baking. | Procedural character generation, dynamic asset variations. |
| **Buffer-Level Agent** | In-Memory glTF JSON | Low ($< 5\text{ms}$) | Direct modification of glTF animation channels, morph targets, and node transforms. | Dynamic procedural pose blending, keyframe retargeting. |
| **ECS Runtime System Agent** | C# WASM ECS System | Real-time ($< 1\text{ms}$) | Direct component mutation via `EntityCommandBuffer`, IK solvers, behavior tree traversal. | Real-time NPC pathing, procedural combat IK, responsive ragdolls. |

## AI Agent Implementation Protocol

* **Perception Phase:** An `AgentPerceptionSystem` queries entities containing `TransformComponent` and `SkeletalMeshComponent`, extracting spatial positions and animation tags into contiguous memory arrays.
* **Reasoning Phase:**
* *Local Model:* Evaluates lightweight ONNX models via `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.WebAssembly` directly in C#.
* *Remote LLM/Agent:* Sends state JSON over WebSockets to an external service, returning structured tool calls (`SetAnimationState`, `ApplyForceToJoint`).


* **Execution Phase:** Mutates target component values in the ECS world. The `TransformPropagationSystem` automatically recalculates downstream joint matrices $M_j$ and flushes updated geometry to PixiJS.

[The Complete glTF Asset Creation Pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTPdNUGwIGc)
This presentation details Blender's native glTF exporter features and node structures essential for building data-compliant skeletal animation pipelines.

*"The Complete glTF Asset Creation Pipeline,"* focuses on the technical intricacies of managing 3D data workflows between Blender and the glTF file format standard. Below is a structured technical tutorial derived from the video's content, detailing the optimal workflow for integrating 3D assets into a glTF pipeline.

### Tutorial: Standardizing the glTF Asset Pipeline

This workflow outlines the technical considerations for ensuring high-fidelity data transmission from Blender to glTF-compatible engines or viewers.

#### 1. Geometry and Shape Key Management

To ensure geometry transfers correctly, users must distinguish between raw data and modifier-processed output.

* **Shape Keys:** These can be exported to glTF [[04:00](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D240)], including specific default values. Note that restricting shape keys via vertex groups is currently unsupported [[06:00](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D360)].
* **Modifiers:** Applying modifiers is necessary for export compatibility [[06:30](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D390)]. However, Blender currently precludes the simultaneous export of applied modifiers and original shape key data [[07:01](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D421)].
* **Point Clouds:** For workflows utilizing point clouds, the exporter supports loose edges and points; ensure these options are explicitly enabled in the settings [[07:45](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D465)].

#### 2. Material Integration and PBR Workflow

The glTF standard utilizes a Physical Based Rendering (PBR) model, primarily compatible with Blender’s Principled BSDF node [[08:44](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D524)].

* **Texture Maps:** Base color maps must be plugged into the base color input [[11:23](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D683)].
* **Occlusion Mapping:** Because standard cycles rendering calculates occlusion automatically, manual setup is required: users must enable the "Shadow Editor" addon to generate the glTF-specific output node for occlusion maps [[23:14](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D1394)].
* **Texture Merging:** The exporter can consolidate metallic and roughness maps into a single texture file during the export process [[15:08](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D908)].

#### 3. Animation and Rigging Protocols

Animations require careful management to ensure compatibility across different software ecosystems.

* **Animation Merging:** To combine distinct animations from multiple objects into a single glTF animation track, define identical names for their respective NLA (Non-Linear Animation) tracks [[30:27](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D1827)].
* **Bone-Driven Animation:** A more sophisticated approach involves using driver-linked shape keys [[39:57](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D2397)]. By driving shape keys via armature bones, the exporter automatically synchronizes the armature and shape key animations [[41:19](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D2479)].

### Tools for Pipeline Validation

To maintain pipeline integrity, professional developers should utilize the following resources:

* **Online glTF Validator:** Essential for ensuring compliance with the official glTF specification [[47:35](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D2855)].
* **Post-Processing Scripts:** Recommended for modifying texture resolutions or converting file formats (e.g., to `.glb` or compressed variants) post-export [[48:15](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D2895)].
* **glTF Viewer Ecosystem:** Tools like Babylon.js or 3JS-based viewers are critical for debugging shaders, geometric tangents, and occlusion maps during the asset integration phase [[35:09](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D2109)], [[48:43](https://www.google.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTPdNUGwIGc%26t%3D2923)].
